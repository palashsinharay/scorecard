Description:  Design your website live from the WP customizer screen : choose your favorite color skin, upload a logo, set up your social profiles, select your front page slider and blocks, set up the layout options (you can even play with the CSS live). Done! The clean and fully responsive design can be used for any type of website: corporate, portfolio, business, blog, landing page, etc. The theme also includes a responsive slider generator (with call to action text and button) to make your pages or posts look beautiful. Customizr is built with HTML5 and CSS3 upon the Twitter Bootstrap framework.
